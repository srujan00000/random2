LLM Image Generator Compliance Guidelines
(For Use in Social Media Post Creation)

1. Purpose & Scope
   These guidelines ensure that all AI-generated imagery for client-facing or public social media posts meets the highest standards of compliance, ethics, security, and brand stewardship. They are mandatory for all team members, designers, prompt engineers, and developers within the organization.

2. Legal, Regulatory, and Ethical Standards
   A. Copyright & Intellectual Property

Source Material: Only create, use, or modify imagery that is 100% original or based on assets to which the organization holds explicit rights or licenses.
Avoid: No replication, close imitation, or style-based prompts referencing protected works, trademarks, or logos of other entities.
Attribution: All imagery and iconography must be unique or sufficiently transformative to avoid IP infringement.

B. Regulatory Compliance

Jurisdictions: Confirm all generated materials comply with the laws/regulations where content is published (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, ADA accessibility, FTC advertising rules).
Content Restrictions: The image generator must actively filter and reject requests relating to:

Hate speech, violence, discrimination, or political campaigning.
Images depicting real, named individuals (including public figures).
Sensitive, misleading, or prohibited subject matter (e.g., financial advice, health claims, regulated industries—unless approved).

C. Accessibility

Contrast & Clarity: Maintain minimum contrast ratios for readability (per WCAG 2.1 AA).
Alternative Text: Every generated asset must have an accurate, descriptive alt text provided for digital accessibility.

3. Brand & Style Compliance

Design Consistency: All visuals must comply with the approved design documentation (see style guide). No deviation in color, typography (Open Sans only), or minimal, geometric, Bauhaus-inspired elements.
Approvals: All new templates, icons, or significant image uses must be reviewed and approved by Brand Compliance or Design Quality leads before deployment.

4. Data Privacy & Security

No Sensitive Data: Images must not contain personal data, client details, confidential information, or visualizations of any protected/private material.
Prompt Security: Prompt data and output logs must be processed and stored per organizational security policy; no use of personally identifiable information (PII) or confidential language in prompts.

5. Usage Restrictions

Internal Testing: Non-compliant, experimental, or draft images may not be shared externally.
Third-Party Sharing: All outputs for third-party/client use must undergo formal compliance and quality review.
Prohibited Use: No generated imagery may be used for impersonation, fraudulent representation, or in contexts that could mislead as to the organization’s intent or involvement.

6. Audit & Recordkeeping

Logging: Maintain detailed records of:

Prompts used, generator settings, and output images.
Approval/tracking logs for audit and quality assurance.

Review Cycle: Conduct periodic compliance audits of both design and prompt workflows, correcting deviations and retraining teams as needed.

7. Governance & Training

Team Training: All relevant staff are required to complete compliance training regarding permissible uses, reporting lines for violations, and escalation protocols.
Incident Reporting: Any suspected policy breach must be reported immediately to the Compliance Office for investigation and remediation.

8. Updates & Ownership

Living Document: These guidelines will be updated in response to evolving legal, regulatory, or internal policy changes.
Point of Contact: The Brand & Compliance Office is responsible for maintaining this guidance and addressing clarifications or exceptions.
