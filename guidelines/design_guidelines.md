Social Media Post AI Agent: LLM Image Generation Design Document

1. Overview
   This document sets standards for the design and generation of visual assets (icons and imagery) for a social media post AI agent. The style should convey clarity, sophistication, and modern aesthetic appeal, maximizing user engagement and digital brand distinctiveness.

2. Design Philosophy

Minimalism: The visuals should be stripped to essentials—clean, uncluttered, and purposeful elements only.
Modern 2D & Flat: No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects. Strict adherence to flat, 2D representation.
Geometric Simplicity: Utilization of basic geometric shapes (circles, squares, rectangles, lines, triangles) as building blocks.
Typography-Centric: Text, characters, and numerals play a prominent visual role—using bold, simple font selections with crisp alignment.
Bauhaus Inspiration: Design should draw from Bauhaus principles: balanced asymmetry, interlocking forms, and clear visual hierarchy.

3. Typography Requirements

Font: All typographic elements—letters, numbers, phrases, or symbols—must use Open Sans font exclusively.
Style Guidance:

Favor bold and/or uppercase styles for visibility.
Maintain clear alignment—centered or grid-based layouts work best.
Do not substitute with other fonts, even for stylistic purposes.

4. Color Palette
   All generated images must use only the following colors:

Orange Accent: #FE7743
Background / Surface: #EFEEEA
Navy / Dark Contrast: #273F4F
Black: #000000

Guidelines:

Use color sparingly to achieve emphasis and hierarchy.
Favor light backgrounds (#EFEEEA); deploy darker hues (#273F4F, #000000) for text and outlines.
Orange (#FE7743) should be used for highlights, focal points, or subtle accents only.

5. Iconography & Imagery
   A. Shape Language

Stick to geometric forms (e.g., pure circles, squares, triangles, straight lines).
Allow interlocking or grid-based arrangements inspired by Bauhaus.

B. Line Work

Consistent stroke weight throughout (recommendation: thin to medium, depending on use).
Prefer straight, perpendicular, or circular lines, avoiding ornate or irregular forms.

C. Visual Density

Ample negative space; visuals should “breathe.”
Limit the number of elements per image or icon (2–4 major forms maximum).

D. Imagery Focus

Abstract or semi-abstract metaphors representing social media activities, conversations, connectivity, AI, or content creation.
Typographic motifs can include single letters, bold numbers, or monospaced phrases as major compositional features (using Open Sans).

6. Examples

Social Media Icon: Two interlocking circles (representing networks), an orange accent line connecting them diagonally, navy outline, on a cream background.
AI/Chat Icon: Speech bubble made from two overlapped rectangles and minimal lines, accented with Bauhaus-style type (monospaced letter “A” in Open Sans) in the center.
Content Creation: Stacked “paper sheets” using rectangles and a small orange dot, signifying new content.

7. Do’s and Don’ts
   Do:

Keep compositions clean and straightforward.
Use the palette exclusively.
Leverage negative space and bold typography (Open Sans only).
Balance Bauhaus geometry with usable, recognizable symbolism.

Don't:

Use gradients, drop shadows, or transparency effects.
Overcrowd the icon/image with too many forms.
Deviate from the geometric, Bauhaus-inspired look.
Substitute Open Sans with any other font.

8. File/Export Guidance

Format: SVG for scalability and crispness.
Dimensions: Standardize at 512px square for consistency (can be scaled down for use).
Background: Always include background color (#EFEEEA).

9. Prompting LLM Image Generation
   For prompt engineers or model fine-tuning:

Provide explicit instructions referencing this document.
Include sample prompt structures, e.g.:

“Create a flat 2D geometric icon for [topic], using only [palette], Bauhaus-inspired, with a typographic element in Open Sans.”
